- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @roucz

I am currently working as an industrial robot programmer in automotive. I am self-taught, and i specialise in KUKA robots.
I would like to broaden my knowledge of programming so i can be more flexible in what i do. Currently i am learning C#.
I have just started on GitHub, so please be patient. Thanks!
